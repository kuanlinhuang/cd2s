## How to get the data

### For a person

1. Open the project in the GDC Data Portal (5 minutes)
   The portal is the authority on how many cases and files this project currently holds. Check those counts against the ones on this page before requesting anything.
   https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/MATCH-C1
2. Request controlled access through dbGaP (days to a few weeks after signing official approval)
   263 controlled-access files hold sequence-level data and are released only under an approved data access request for phs002177. The request starts at dbGaP, not in the portal, and it is your institution's signing official who submits it.
   Requires: eRA Commons account, institutional signing official approval, dbGaP data access request for phs002177
   https://gdc.cancer.gov/access-data/obtaining-access-controlled-data
3. Download controlled files with your token
   An approved request yields a token that expires monthly. The same manifest fetches nothing without it.
   Requires: approved dbGaP request, GDC authentication token
   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002177

   ```
   gdc-client download -m gdc_manifest.txt -t gdc-user-token.txt
   ```

### From code

4. Query the project from code, with no credentials
   The file index is public even where the files are not, so an agent can size a cohort before anyone requests access.
   https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/API/Users_Guide/Getting_Started/

   ```
   curl -s 'https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/files' --get \
     --data-urlencode 'filters={"op":"and","content":[{"op":"in","content":{"field":"cases.project.project_id","value":["MATCH-C1"]}},{"op":"in","content":{"field":"access","value":["open"]}}]}' \
     --data-urlencode 'fields=file_id,file_name,data_type' \
     --data-urlencode 'size=10000' \
     --data-urlencode 'format=TSV' > files.tsv
   ```
5. Pass the token when the agent needs controlled files
   Without a token the same endpoints return the open subset and HTTP 200. An agent that treats a short result as the whole cohort will silently under-count; filter on access and compare against the counts on this page.
   Requires: GDC authentication token
   https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/API/Users_Guide/Getting_Started/

   ```
   curl -H "X-Auth-Token: $GDC_TOKEN" \
     'https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/data/<file_id>' -o file.bam
   ```

## Provenance

- Review status: machine_only
  This page's interpretation has NOT been human-reviewed. Counts and field coverage are machine-measured and reliable; the absence of a limitations list means nobody has written one, not that there are no limitations.
