# Prostate Cancer MDA PCa PDX (MD Anderson, Clin Cancer Res 2024)

Dataset id: cbio-prad-msk-mdanderson-2023

## Read this first: what these data CANNOT support

- No blocking limitation has been recorded. This is not the same as there being none: check the review status below.

## What it is

- Cohort: 38 cases
- Cancer types: Prostate
- Subject: Prostate
- Measurements: Mutation calls (panel, exome or genome), Copy number alterations, RNA sequencing expression, Structural variants / fusions
- Treatment response recorded: False
- Access: open. Processed data download from the cBioPortal study page or its public REST API; no account required. Primary raw data remain wherever the original investigators deposited them.

## Clinical field completeness

Populated means a value exists; informative excludes 'not reported'.

- Race Category: 100.0% informative
- Sex: 100.0% informative

## How to get the data

### For a person

1. Open the study in cBioPortal (5 minutes)
   Harmonized mutation, copy-number, expression and clinical files, open to anyone. Cite the original publication, and cite cBioPortal if the portal's harmonized files were used.
   https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=prad_msk_mdanderson_2023
2. Download the whole study as a zip (minutes)
   The datasets page carries one zip per study: the same staging files the portal itself loads. The datahub S3 bucket that older guides quote is no longer readable anonymously.
   https://www.cbioportal.org/datasets
3. Or pull the staging files with git-lfs
   Useful when you want one study out of a version-controlled copy. Study folders are named by study id under public/.
   https://github.com/cBioPortal/datahub

   ```
   git lfs install --skip-repo --skip-smudge
   git clone https://github.com/cBioPortal/datahub.git && cd datahub
   git lfs install --local --skip-smudge
   git -c lfs.fetchexclude="" lfs pull -I public/prad_msk_mdanderson_2023
   ```

### From code

4. Read the study straight off the REST API
   No key and no account; the API is rate-limited per address, so an agent sweeping many studies should pace itself.
   https://docs.cbioportal.org/web-api-and-clients/

   ```
   curl -s 'https://www.cbioportal.org/api/studies/prad_msk_mdanderson_2023/clinical-data?clinicalDataType=PATIENT&projection=SUMMARY'
   ```

## Evidence of prior reuse

- This dataset has no accession specific enough to search for, so reuse cannot be traced through the literature. Absence of evidence here is not evidence of absence.

## Provenance

- Review status: machine_only
  This page's interpretation has NOT been human-reviewed. Counts and field coverage are machine-measured and reliable; the absence of a limitations list means nobody has written one, not that there are no limitations.
