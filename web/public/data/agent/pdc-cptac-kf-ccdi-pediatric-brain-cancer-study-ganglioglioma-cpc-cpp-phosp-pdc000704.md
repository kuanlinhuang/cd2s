## How to get the data

### For a person

1. Open the study in the PDC portal (5 minutes)
   Proteomic data are released open: no account, no request, no waiting.
   https://pdc.cancer.gov/pdc/study/PDC000704
2. Accept the data use guidelines and download (minutes to hours, by study size)
   The portal asks you to accept the guidelines at download time. They ask for citation and acknowledgement, not for approval.
   https://pdc.cancer.gov/pdc/data-use-guidelines

### From code

3. Resolve the study UUID, then fetch the file manifest
   filesPerStudy keys on the version UUID, not on PDC000704. Passing the PDC study id returns one row per file with every field null - a successful call that looks like a study whose files carry no metadata. Resolve the latest version through studyCatalog first. acceptDUA: true is the programmatic form of the portal's terms click; without it there are no signed download URLs.

   ```
   python3 - <<'PY'
   import requests
   STUDY = "PDC000704"
   GQL = "https://pdc.cancer.gov/graphql"
   catalog = requests.post(GQL, json={"query": "{ studyCatalog(acceptDUA: true) { pdc_study_id versions { study_id is_latest_version } } }"}).json()["data"]["studyCatalog"]
   uuid = next(v["study_id"] for s in catalog if s["pdc_study_id"] == STUDY
               for v in s["versions"] if v["is_latest_version"] == "yes")
   q = '{ filesPerStudy(study_id: "%s" acceptDUA: true) { file_id file_name file_type data_category } }' % uuid
   files = requests.post(GQL, json={"query": q}).json()["data"]["filesPerStudy"]
   print(len(files), "files")
